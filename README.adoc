Let me start out by clarifying the difference between Bitcoin and Blockchain, in broad strokes, for anyone not familiar with them.
"Bitcoin" is used to refer to both the digital currency - the unit of value - and the software system that allows you to exchange this currency.
I'll use BTC for clarity when referring to the currency.
Mostly, we're going to be talking about the system.

Blockchain is basically a special-purpose distributed database.
It's like an account book - the part of the system that stores transactions - and Bitcoin wraps software around it to control how transactions get added.
Some of that logic is specific to Bitcoin's idea of totally anonymous, decentralized trust.
If you're a group of banks trying to record transactions, or a group of people within an organization, you can still use Blockchain, but wrap different rules around it.

I've been to a number of talks about Bitcoin and Blockchain recently, and I've found them kinda frustrating.
They're given by enthusiasts who go on about all the cool things you'll be able to do with these technologies, how they're going to revolutionize finance and commerce, without explaining how they work.
I understand not wanting to get too deep in the weeds for a general audience, but without a basic grasp of how these technologies work, people can't trust them.
That's a problem because the entire point of Bitcoin is to replace trust in institutions - government and banks - with trust in technology.
If you don't understand the technology, you're trusting the people selling the technology.
And you should always be skeptical of people trying to sell you something.

Spoiler: Bitcoin and Blockchain are not magical, perfect, and flawless.
They have problems - some straightforwardly technical and probably solvable, but some at that tricky and unavoidable intersection of people and technology.

I'm not going to go all that deep, but I want to strip away at least one layer of magic.
Bitcoin builds on a few well-understood cryptographic technologies.
While Bitcoin combines and uses them in new ways, these are the same tools you use every time you go to a secure web site.
They have survived decades of scrutiny.
I trust them.

There are only two fundamental tools, and everything else builds on them.
They are public key cryptography and hash functions.
They're based on some really complicated math, stuff that's way over my head.
The good news is that you don't have to understand the math to understand how it works - in particular, its limitations, how it could fail, and what happens when it does.

Just a note: I'm going to use words like "never", "impossible", and "cannot".
You should imagine that they always have a little asterisk next to them referring you to a footnote with a long-winded caveat about breakthroughs in fundamental mathematical theory, advances in quantum computing, or mistakes in software implementations.
I'm also going to use words like "unlikely" and "improbable". These are understatements.
They describe probabilities like 1/N where N is the number of atoms in the universe (NoAiU, for later).

== Symmetric Cryptography

In the oldest, simplest forms of cryptography, you take a message and replace each letter in it with a different letter according to some formula.
In short:

****
message -> math! -> encrypted message
****

Here, the math is the secret part. If you know the math, you can decrypt the message.
A classic one is Rot-13, where you "rotate" each letter of the alphabet by 13, so "a" becomes "n", "b" becomes "o", and so on.
To decrypt the message, you just rotate each letter back.
It's a pretty dumb cipher.
Modern encryption is way more sophisticated, but fundamentally it's still:

****
data -> math! -> encrypted data
****

One important innovation is the concept of "keys":

****
data -> math(key)! -> encrypted data
****

Here the math part is not the secret.
In fact, the more public scrutiny it gets, the more trustworthy it is.
What's secret is the key.
Normally (in what we'll now call "symmetric key cryptography") you use the same key for encrypting and decrypting:

****
data -> math(key)! -> encrypted data -> math(key)! -> data
****

The tricky thing with this scheme is getting the key safely to someone else that you want to be able to decrypt your message.

== Public Key Cryptography

In public key cryptography, there are two keys.
You can use either key to encrypt, but anything you encrypt with one can only be decrypted with the other:

****
data -> math(keyA)! -> encrypted data -> math(*keyB*)! -> data +
data -> math(keyA)! -> encrypted data -> math(*keyA*)! -> garbage
****

One of them is private, one is public.
The private key, you have to keep safe and secret. Really, really safe.
The public key, you give out to anyone. Publish it.
Register it with your email address in a public registry.

You can send someone a secret message by encrypting it with their public key.
As long as only they have their private key, only they can decrypt it.
This has two corollaries that we'll come back to later: If they lose their private key, they can't decrypt it; and anyone who steals their private key can.

The other thing you can do is encrypt a message with your private key.
Anyone can decrypt it with your public key, so it's not a secret, but they know that you encrypted it.

We can do both of these in combination.
If I encrypt something with my private key and your public key, only you can read it, and you know it came from me.

How you deal with keys being stolen is a whole topic on its own. We'll get to that later.

== Cryptographic Hash Functions

A hash function is math that takes in data and spits out a single number.
The data can be anything from a single byte to a high-def movie file.

****
data -> math! -> number
****

There are a few key things about this:

* The same data always generates the same number
* It's not reversible - you can't reconstruct the input data from the output number
* Different data can generate the same number (a "collision")

*Cryptographic* hash functions use really sophisticated math to guarantee a few more things:

* Collisions are highly unlikely (again, 1/NoAiU)
* Modifying the data slightly generates a completely different output
* There's no way to predictably modify the data to generate a specific output (to cause a collision)

This gives you a shorthand way to ask, "Have I seen this before?"
It's really useful for two kinds of data: secret things and big things.

So for example, an authentication system could store the hash of a password rather than the password itself.
When someone enters a password, its hash is calculated and compared to the stored value.
If someone steals the stored value, all it lets them do is guess at the password and know if they guessed right.
(They can try a lot of guesses really fast, which is why you need long passwords.)

This also gives you a shortcut for comparing data files: Rather than checking byte by byte, you can calculate the hash of both, and compare those.

For developers, the most familiar use of hashes is Git.
It keeps hashes of files so it knows if they've changed, and each commit is identified by a hash of everything in it.

As another example, I wrote https://gist.github.com/bluegraybox/228fc0ab333d2268f16e3b73c0cc2c36[a tiny Ruby script] to go through all my MP3 files to look for duplicates.
It reads each file, calculates a hash for it, and keeps a look-up table of hashes to file paths.
If the hash is already in the dictionary, it prints out a message with the old and new file paths.

[source,ruby]
----
digests = {}
Find.find( dir ) do |f|
    if File.file?( f ) and File.size?( f ) then
        d = MD5.file( f ).hexdigest
        if digests[d] then
            puts "Duplicates: #{digests[d]} and #{f}"
        else
            digests[d] = f
        end
    end
end
----

== Digital Signatures

As mentioned, I could encrypt a document with my private key, and anyone could decrypt it and verify that it came from me.
But a better option is to run the document through a hash function, then just encrypt the hash value with your private key. That's a digital signature.
The document is readable, but anyone can verify the signature by decrypting it with your public key, hashing the document, and comparing the two.

*Signing*

*Verification*

== Transactions

Ok, now we're getting into the actual bitcoin and blockchain part of this.

When we talk about bitcoin payments, we imagine that it's like exchanging cash, and a lot of the hype around bitcoin reinforces this.
But that's actually a really misleading metaphor.
The blockchain is like a big account book with every transaction ever written in it.
The only reason it's anonymous is that everyone is only identified by their public key.
(And any one person can use multiple keys to muddy the waters.)

With other financial accounts, like checking or credit, you have a balance, and transactions modify that balance.
Bitcoin doesn't store a balance: it has to be calculated by summing up all the payments to you that you haven't spent.

So when you make a payment, you don't have a pool of money to pay it out of; you have a bunch of individual transactions.
You have to say something like "take that 5 BTC from transaction 13a16... and give it to 72fc3...."

For reasons we'll get into later, you can't spend part of a transaction. It all has to go somewhere.
What you can do is split it up and pay some of it back to yourself.
"From transaction 13a16... give 2 BTC to 72fc3... and 3 BTC to 43b46...."

image:slides/img/transactions-1.png[split payment]

You can also do many-to-one or many-to-many transactions.
You can take a bunch of little payments you've received, combine them into one bigger payment to someone else, and pay the difference back to yourself.

image:slides/img/transactions-2.png[many-to-many]

Or just collect them all into a single transaction.

=== Validation

A Transaction, as it's recorded in the blockchain, is a set of inputs and outputs - payments from and to.
Every input is the output from a previous transaction.
You take payments that were made to you, and use them to pay someone else.

So how is ownership enforced? What stops you from pretending to be someone else?

The transaction output doesn't just have a public key; it has a little executable script that is used to verify any claims to it.
The script takes a public key and a signature of its own transaction as inputs - that's what you have to provide to claim it.
The script checks that the public key is the one expected, uses that public key to decrypt the signature provided, and compares that to the hash of its own transaction.
That proves that the claimant has the private key matching the public key required.
The process is:

image:slides/img/verification.png[verify]

In pseudocode, that's:

    function valid(signature, publicKey) {
        return hash(publicKey) == "43b46ef2e61a3d6a725fe70fe2b3adaadbca7348" &&
            decrypt(signature, publicKey) == hash(inputTransactionBytes())
    }

Here's a full example transaction from the https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction#Principle_example_of_a_Bitcoin_transaction_with_1_input_and_1_output_only[Bitcoin wiki].
----
Input:
Previous tx: f5d8ee39a430901c91a5917b9f2dc19d6d1a0e9cea205b009ca73dd04470b9a6

90db022100e2ac980643b0b82c0e88ffdfec6b64e3e6ba35e7ba5fdd7d5d6cc8d25c6b241501

Output:
Value: 5000000000
scriptPubKey: OP_DUP OP_HASH160 404371705fa9bd789a2fcd52d2c580b65d35549d
OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
----

That's the scripting language at the bottom. It actually includes a hash of the public key, not the full key, which is more anonymous and more compact.
"scriptSig" is the signature and public key that will be fed into the script for the input ("Previous tx").
Also note that the input section doesn't have an amount - that comes from the previous transaction.
("Index" says which output we're claiming.)

So a chain of transactions could look like:

image:slides/img/transaction.png[transactions]

Ok, so I can create a new transaction that takes Bitcoin from previous transactions and transfers it to someone else.
And we've got a mechanism that lets someone verify that I'm allowed to do that.
But part of that verification requires that they can look up the input transactions and know that they're valid.
Which means that all of _their_ inputs have to have been validated.
And so on and so on.
How do we store that transaction history and not have to validate the whole chain of previous transactions?

== Blockchain

That brings us to the actual blockchain.
Rather than validating and storing each transaction individually, they're grouped into blocks, along with header data which includes hashes of its own transactions and of the previous block's header.
Modifying an earlier block would change its hash, making any tampering evident.

image:slides/img/blockchain.png[blockchain]

As new transactions are added, it also updates an index (like a database index).
This allow verifiers to quickly look up individual transactions.
By removing transactions from the index when their outputs are all spent, it solves another problem: double-spending.
If I have an input that gives me 2 BTC, I can create two new transactions that transfer it to different people.
Each of those looks valid on its own, but we can't allow both of them.
If they're in the same block, it's easy to catch, but we also need to be able to check against historical transactions.

== Proof of Work

So far, there's no reason the blockchain couldn't be a centralized database.
All transactions get sent to it, it validates them and adds them to the blockchain.
Simple.
And for some of the use cases people talk about, they could totally do that.

But the entire point of Bitcoin is to avoid that central authority.
Everyone has their own copy of the database.
Everyone can validate a block of transactions and send it out to the rest of the network to add to their chains.
But the chain needs to be consistent.
 Everyone needs to agree on what transactions have happened.
With thousands of people trying to add new blocks to the chain all the time, how do you decide which one to add?
(This is another reason transactions are validated in blocks, rather than individually.)
You could choose one at random, but how do you do that if nobody is in charge to do the choosing?
The solution to this problem is what makes Bitcoin Bitcoin, and it's really simple and elegant.

If you calculate the hash for a transaction block, you'll get a number that's effectively random.
When you look at that random output as a binary number, there's a 50% chance that the first bit will be zero, a 25% chance that the first two bits will be zero, and so on.
By the time you get to 40 bits, you're talking about one in a trillion.

So what Bitcoin does is add a Nonce field, a sort of filler, to the transaction block.
It has no effect except to change the hash value of the block.
For the block itself to be valid, its hash has to have at least a certain number of leading zeros.

To find a filler value that will make the block validate is a matter of brute force guesswork:
Set a new random number, calculate the hash, see if it matches, try again.
Given the total compute power of the network, you can estimate how long it would take to find a hash with a certain number of leading zeros.
The bitcoin software actually adjusts the number of leading zeros required so that the time required to find a valid block remains fairly constant, at around ten minutes.

image:slides/img/proof_of_work.png[proof of work]

A nice thing about this is that nobody has to agree in advance what the block of transactions is.
(Since it's a distributed network, everyone will receive transactions in a slightly different order.)
Everyone can work on validating their own block, and whoever generates a valid block first broadcasts it.
Everyone else checks that it's valid and adds it to their chain.
They stop work on their block, discard any transactions that were added in the new block, and start building a new block.

== Smart Contracts

A while back, you may have been wondering why transaction outputs include this complicated validation script, rather than just a public key.
What using a script lets you do is define other conditions for validating the transaction.

In a simple example, the script could require two out of three signatures: a buyer, seller, and arbitrator.
The seller can't claim the payment on their own.
If the buyer is happy, they sign it.
If not, the arbitrator can sign or not sign, depending on their judgement.
The buyer and seller still need a real-world trust that the arbitrator is honest.

If instead, it's a bet on the outcome of a sports game or the price of a stock, the arbitrator could be a program that uses web services to detect if the right conditions are met.
That's more efficient, but again, the participants are trusting that program.

Another example is a Kickstarter-style fundraiser.
Create a transaction that pays you 100 BTC, and allow anyone to add inputs to it.
Until they add up to 100 BTC, the transaction won't validate and you won't be able to spend it.
Once they do, you will.

In theory, you could also have transactions that are only valid after a certain date, but this capability was disabled in Bitcoin due to concerns about Denial-of-Service attacks.
It may well be workable in a private blockchain network, among trusted parties.
This would allow escrow transactions and returnable deposits.

There's an inherent limitation of Smart Contracts: The only way to mathematically guarantee that money can be paid in the future is to lock it up now.
Any transaction that pays someone in the future takes the money away from you today.
They won't be able to spend it until the time limit is up, but you won't either.
If you wanted your rent for the next year to be paid automatically every month with a Smart Contract, you'd effectively have to pay the full year up front.

== Problems

Key management
    hard drive crashes
    stolen keys

Ooops
    typos
    contested charges - fewer, but harder to resolve

Bitcoin

== Potential

"value" could be anything: title to car or house, any property

distributed transaction network
    We're starting to realize that all data storage is distributed, and has the problems of distributed systems.
    What we have now are systems that pretend to be authoritative systems of record, and just have elaborate backup, fail-over, and conflict resolution mechanisms.
